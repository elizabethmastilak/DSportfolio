BAIS 462 Programming in Analytics aims to prepare undergraduate students to produce code 
in a statistical software environment in order to prepare students for the workforce.

This class consists of a series of homework assignments designed to teach students the basics of visualizations, 
API calls, text analysis (sentiment scoring, simple valence), and ethical web scraping. The class culminates in a 
final project designed to demonstrate the skills addressed in the class and introduce the student as a graduate of 
a Business Analytics program. 

Included in this repository are assignments in which I demonstrate API calls and ethical webscraping. In addition, 
I have included my final project, which demonstrates visualizations, text analysis, and web scraping.
