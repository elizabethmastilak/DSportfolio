Gillian,11/14/2024,"I am so impressed by the OTD (Occupational Therapy Doctorate) program at UC! It's worth mentioning that the OT field is changing, and with it, a new requirement for a doctorate for entry-level OT jobs. Thus, UC's direct entry doctorate program allows anyone with a bachelor's degree, in any field, to apply!  UC is only in its second year of doing this program, so the small staff of professors working with UC are all real world OTs in addition to teaching, somehow consistently available and working with student feedback to continually improve the program for us. Additionally, it's an incredibly inclusive atmosphere. 5 stars all the way.",University of Cincinnati
Emma,10/23/2024,"The University of Cincinnati stands out to me as a vibrant hub of innovation and community engagement. Its commitment to experiential learning allows students to apply their knowledge in real-world settings, fostering not just academic growth but also personal development. The campus itself is a blend of rich history and modern design, creating an inspiring environment that encourages creativity. Overall, UC embodies a forward-thinking spirit that resonates with my aspirations and ignites my enthusiasm for learning.",University of Cincinnati
Claire,07/29/2024,"The campus, atmosphere, and location is stunning. The campus has a large group of people, differing in race, sexual orientation, majors, religion, and much more, yet they all seem to have respect and appreciation for one another, which was incredibly inspiring to see.",University of Cincinnati
Lily,02/13/2024,"University of Cincinnati is a strong state school however could improve on safety, housing options, food options. Overall the campus is super walkable but one must be careful at night and. by themselves. There are many clubs and organizations that one can easily be involved in",University of Cincinnati
Lily,12/01/2024,"Something that really stuck out while I visited Purdue's campus was how alive the campus felt, while touring I saw hundreds of people walking from class to class. It gave me a feeling of how this campus acts as its own little town as well, creating a small environment for me to grow socially and intellectually. I feel as though this is my top choice as a current high school senior, and I am happy to say so.",Purdue University
Bart,06/11/2024,"A institution of learning with a passion for students to stay on the journey to succeed in being tomorrow's best. When I enrolled in March 2024; the hardest thing is patiently waiting for response on the multiple transcripts I have submitted. At Purdue University.  I feel more than a student. A scholar with a passion to learn , to laugh and live the dream which is FEMA.",Purdue University
Jaimie,04/01/2024,"When I first came to Purdue, I noticed that it has a very lively campus that encourages diversity and inclusion. This campus is very welcoming and celebrates all interests in a way that accurately reflects the schools values. Yes, it is known for its high quality academics and education, but Purdue promotes social gatherings just as much!",Purdue University
Molly,02/12/2024,"With my time at Purdue University, I do not have one bad thing to say about it. The campus provides so many resources for any of your needs. The campus may be large but they find a way to make it feel very inclusive, and feel like you are a part of something.",Purdue University
V,12/08/2024,"Pennsylvania State University-Main Campus offers an outstanding academic environment with a strong reputation for excellence, especially in fields like Health Policy and Administration. The university provides a comprehensive and rigorous education that prepares students to make meaningful contributions in their careers. With its commitment to research, community engagement, and hands-on learning opportunities, Penn State is an ideal place for me to pursue my degree and achieve my career goals in healthcare policy. Additionally, the diverse campus culture and strong alumni network offer a supportive environment that will help me grow both personally and professionally.",Pennsylvania State University
Shostika,10/18/2024,"Penn State's main campus is huge, with plenty of extracurriculars to meet new people and form friendships. Academics are challenging but rewarding, requiring effort and dedication. Professors are supportive, often offering help beyond office hours to ensure student success. It's a place to grow both academically and socially.",Pennsylvania State University
Aaliyah,06/29/2024,"Before coming to school I was worried about not finding friends or out of class activities. Looking back on this past year, I realize there was nothing to worry about. Students gather on HUB lawn when it’s nice out for games of football or frisbee. Everyone is open to meeting people and this is an amazing place to do so. There are multiple dining halls across campus so there is no need to worry about being hungry after class. Pollock has the best dining hall but the dorms are not as nice as the rest. East dorms are the best as they are newly renovated but quite far from downtown and many places on campus. If you are worried about finding clubs, don’t worry! There is a club fair where thousands gather to introduce themselves and their clubs. Speaking of fairs, we also have job fairs. This is where you can find possible internships and future employment. Our school has an amazing alumni network. Although Penn State is such a large school, we are all still family. The alumni are elated to help current and possible Penn Staters. The fairs are great ways to find activities for yourself and meet people. The only downside is that it can get quite overwhelming with the amount of people. If you feel to busy for a set club there are many activities that go on across campus everyday. Like many students at Penn State if you are interested in greek life there are many fraternities and sororities to choose from. If that’s not your thing, that’s okay too. The sports culture at our school in very vibrant. We have club sports teams if you’re interested and many D-1 games happening all year. From one Penn Stater to the next, you don’t want to miss out! Overall, deciding to go to Penn State has been an amazing decision. One that I would never go back on. The opportunities are endless.",Pennsylvania State University
Holly,06/28/2024,"Caveat, I Graduated in 2014 and things may have changed in the last 10 years. The academics for Penn State are great.... if you are in one of their four favorite schools. The alumni associate is vast and helpful....also only if you are in one of those four schools (education, business, engineering, and Computer Science.) Support post graduation can be lackluster, and their non architecture arts department is so undervalued the building didnt even have a front door. Faculty however is amazing, some of the best people i have ever met. If you do go to main campus, either the sports scene or THON (student philanthropy dance marathon) will probably be the main topic of conversations around campus.",Pennsylvania State University
Hailey,12/11/2024,"I loved my experience at Michigan State University. The college is beautiful and historic, with many updated facilities. There is truly space for everyone and their interests, with tons of social and academic clubs to join. Football game days are huge and there is always an overwhelming sense of community. The academics are stellar. When you attend a school that has a recognizable name, internships and post grad job opportunities are endless. One of my favorite parts of campus was the botanical garden. It is incredible to have a beautiful display of nature on campus. I highly recommend MSU. Go Green!",Michigan State University
Madelyn,11/26/2024,"It is difficult to find your place within the collage and it is a major culture shock if you are from a small town like me. some people here are super helpful while others seem to hate their jobs, you have to be able to advocate for yourself and find people willing to help.",Michigan State University
Chloe,06/24/2024,"I am currently a rising sophomore at Michigan State University. Coming into college last fall I was skeptical. Michigan State wasn't my top choice as I knew little about campus life or the environment. But now I know it was the best choice. Michigan State has a great work-life balance. Their programs and facilities are top-tier, with small and big class sizes depending on your liking, numerous academic and social opportunities for all majors, and great places to have fun( with the campus on Grand River, there are many restaurants and shops). It is almost always easy to find your perfect community at Michigan State, and I'm so lucky to call it my home.",Michigan State University
Holly,05/29/2024,"I love how beautiful the campus is. The nice parks and wonderful recreational activities are very appealing and the students are also very kind and helpful. I enjoyed walking around, meeting people, and touring the facilities. My elder brother also goes to MSU, so I've had lots of time to get to know the area and fall in love with it.",Michigan State University
Norman,11/25/2024,Louisiana State University is overall a great school. I feel welcomed when I am there. The campus itself is very beautiful. The environmental structure of the school itself is superb. The professors are very nice and made me feel welcomed and provided me with the information I needed. Overall great school.,Louisiana State University
Mariah,11/25/2024,"It's a great school with great opportunities although there are some downfalls. The professors are absolutely splendid but some classes are so large that learning is struggle. With there being so many students, housing gets pushed to the side. Getting advising is also rather difficult. Once you get into the swing of things, being a student at LSU also becomes easier.",Louisiana State University
Earl,07/09/2024,LSU is an ok school depending on what you're there for so your major and motives play a big role in how much you get out of it/enjoy it.,Louisiana State University
Cody,06/01/2024,"It’s a great university for my academics and extracurricular activity, playing football or running track. My father died before I was born. My mother was 6 months pregnant with me. My mother is a clerk at the local court house. Her minimum wage has barely got me through high school. I have a 3.0 Gpa in hopes of getting into a college.",Louisiana State University

Derry,06/10/2023,"Overall an outstanding University. I see myself continuing to study here, and even live in the general area. I hope I can be admitted to the Medical School. The people really make the experience everything, and I can attest, starting from my first visit.",Emory University
Julia,10/12/2022,"Everyone at this school is so so kind. There is always a friendly face. The academics are superior as well. This school is definitely the ""Ivy League of the South"" and often goes unnoticed. There isn't a lot of hype around sports because we don't have a football team.",Emory University

ku,10/23/2024,"This is my first year here as a transfer student classified as a junior. Obviously, I got the ""transfer shock"" as well as the feeling of homesickness where I miss my family and my community college peers. However, things have gotten better and I feel comfortable adapting to this new environment. It is always like that! I look forward to many more opportunities here at Auburn.",Auburn University
Alaya,09/08/2024,"So far my experience at Auburn University has been quite well. There are plenty of events and activities for students to do especially in the first 56 days of classes . All the professors seem to do their job very well and everyone is so kind and the overall vibe of campus is just really good. This is my opinion as of right now, but it definitely could change within the next couple of months.",Auburn University
Ashtynn,07/27/2024,Auburn is a beautiful campus and everyone wants you to succeed! It is very easy to make friends when you get involved. The small town community is so welcoming and warm. There are clubs for every need and interest as well as many different religions and cultures.,Auburn University
Megan,06/25/2024,"Auburn is the nicest campus in AL and has the best food and shops, Auburn's atmosphere is quiet and friendly, all the teachers are there to help each and every student, students are helpful and the campus is easy to get around, the games are incredible and student sections are full",Auburn University
