As part of Xavier University's Data Science Honors Bachelor of Science, sophomore students take 
DSCI 210 - Data and American Democracy. For this class, students work with XU's Philosophy, Politics, 
and the Public program to volunteer with local campaigns in Hamilton County, OH. 

Students from both the Data Science major and the Pilosophy, Politics, and the Public major learn how 
campaigns operate, what is involved in creating a campaign strategy, how elections work, and more. As part 
of their class, Data Science majors create visualizations from past election cycles. These visualizations 
include maps from the list of registered voters, graphs representing the ages of voters by political affiliation,
maps summarizing votes from previous campaigns including differences between national and local elections, and more.

For this course, I was assigned to work with Melissa Powers who was running for election as Hamilton County 
Prosecutor after being appointed to the position in 2023 following former Prosecutor Joseph Deters'
appointment to the Ohio Supreme Court. 

This repository includes the code and visualizations I contributed to the campaign and created for the class.
