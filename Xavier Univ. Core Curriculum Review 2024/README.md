As part of Xavier University's Data Science Honors Bachelor of Science, rising sophomore students are offered 
the chance to participate in a month-long summer program working for the University as data science 
interns. For this program, the 2024 interns were assigned to analyze data related to Xavier's Core Curriculum. 

This data included what classes students were taking to fulfill Core Curriculum (CC) requirements, what grades they 
were recieving, and when they were taking these classes. Our goal was to determine how Xavier students are experiencing
the CC as students, i.e. what does the average Xavier student need to take to fulfill CC requirements?

One of my contributions to the project was an analysis of which CC requirements can be fulfilled through classes required by
the student's major. For example, a Mathematics major will not have to take an extra class to fulfill their Quantitative
Reasoning requirement or their Mathematical Perspectives requirement as most of their courses as a Math major already
fulfill these requirements. Likewise, a History major would consider their Historical Perspecives class to be part of their
major requirements and a Spanish major wouldn't consider the second language requirements to be an extra burden on their 
requirements to graduate. Understanding which CC requirements related to a students major and which ones impose an extra class
on students was incredibly relevant to our understanding of how a student might experience the CC. 

At the end of the internship experience, we presented our work to two of the Associate Provosts. 

Included in this repository is a selection of my code and the final presentation (as a pdf) from our project.
